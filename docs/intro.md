# Layout Designer Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing a dynamic layout designer using **Craft.js** integrated with **DevExtreme** components.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation will take you through a complete journey of building a powerful, drag-and-drop layout designer. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking implementation details, this guide covers everything you need to know.

## Overview

Layout designers have become essential tools in modern web applications, enabling users to create dynamic interfaces without writing code. Our implementation combines the flexibility of Craft.js with the rich component library of DevExtreme to create a robust solution for visual interface building.
